## Org/Store Scoping Rules

- **Locations = stores** – One org can have many locations.
- **No cross-org access** – A user in Org A cannot query or modify Org B data.
- **SUPER_ADMIN** – Must explicitly pass `X-Org-Id` or `?orgId=` to scope. No global view (prevents data breach).
- **Other roles** – Must have `orgId` assigned. Requests are always scoped to their org.
- **Locations CRUD** – SUPER_ADMIN and ADMIN only.

## Request Context

After `requireOrgContext`, `req.orgContext` contains:

- `orgId` – Current org scope (required for all scoped routes; SUPER_ADMIN must pass header/query)
- `locationId` – Optional store scope from `X-Location-Id` or user default
- `role` – User’s role

Headers (SUPER_ADMIN only):

- `X-Org-Id` – Scope to a specific org
- `X-Location-Id` – Scope to a specific store

## Promote/Demote Users

1. **Allowed users** – Stored in `allowed_users` with `replit_user_id`, `org_id`, `role`.
2. **Promote** – Update `role` (e.g. CASHIER → MANAGER) and optionally `org_id`.
3. **Demote** – Update `role` to a lower level.
4. **SUPER_ADMIN** – Only one platform owner; `org_id` is null.
5. **Admin UI** – `/api/admin/allowed-users` (ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN only) to manage users.

## Migration from Legacy Owner

- `isOwner = 1` in `allowed_users` maps to `role = 'SUPER_ADMIN'`.
- First user to log in becomes SUPER_ADMIN if no owner exists.
- Run `npm run seed` after `npm run db:push` to create org, location, roles, and sample products.
